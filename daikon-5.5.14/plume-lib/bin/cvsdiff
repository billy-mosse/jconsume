#!/bin/bash
# I do not understand why, on my Ubuntu laptop as of 1/17/2007, the line
# "#!/bin/sh" causes the error "/bin/sh: Can't open cleanup-cvsdiff" whereas
# "#!/bin/bash" works.  (I see this when running under the two shells, too.)

# Run "cvs diff", but eliminate some extraneous output
cvs -q diff -b -u "$@" 2>&1 | cvsdiff-cleanup
